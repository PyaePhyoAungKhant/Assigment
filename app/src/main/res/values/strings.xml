    <string name="letter">Thank-you letters aren’t just for that all-important job interview follow-up. Although it’s essential to send a thank-you after an interview, there are plenty of other reasons to send thanks. You might consider thanking people who’ve helped you with a job search, for instance, or someone you met at an event who hooked you up with networking leads. Why not formally thank a colleague who filled in for you while you were on vacation, or your supervisor, who went out of her way to help you get time off on short notice? And don’t forget to send a thank-you note to Grandma. She worked hard on that crocheted blanket! And she probably remembers a time when thank-you cards were required etiquette for such gifts.</string>
